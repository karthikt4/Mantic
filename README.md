I am Rotarian Karthik Kubendran, a Senior Graphic Designer from Bangalore. I have always been passionate about computer games right from my childhood days where I used to spend lots of time playing games on my computer at home. I was very passionate about games and at one point decided to change my passion into my profession as a career option.
